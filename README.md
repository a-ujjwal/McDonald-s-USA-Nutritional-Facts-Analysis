# McDonald's-USA-Nutritional-Facts-Analysis
For this project, I have used Google Sheets and Tableau. While Tableau was used for the visualization part, Google Sheets made the data cleaning and pre-processing easier. In the data cleaning stage, the data was checked for any Null or NA values, followed by browsing the Category field for any outliers.  

Head Over to [this](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/a.ujjwal/viz/McDonaldsUSA-NutritionalFactsAnalysis/McDUSANutritionalFactsAnalysis) link to check out the analysis.
